							Our Story
						</h3>

						<p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
							The journey of He and She Store began with a shared passion for fashion and a dream to create an online store that would be more than just a place to shop. It was founded by Jane and Mark, two individuals who believed in the power of fashion to empower and uplift people.
							Jane, a fashion enthusiast with a background in e-commerce, and Mark, an entrepreneur with a keen eye for design, decided to merge their talents and visions to create a unique platform. They wanted to provide a space where fashion would be a means of self-expression, a reflection of individuality, and a source of confidence.
						</p>

						<p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
							He and She Store is a testament to their commitment to breaking the norms of the fashion industry. It was born out of a desire to make fashion accessible and inclusive, where people of all backgrounds, sizes, and identities could find clothing that resonated with them.

							As they navigated the journey of building the store, Jane and Mark also made sure that sustainability and ethics were at the core of their business.

								Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.
